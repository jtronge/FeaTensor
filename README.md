# **FeaTensor: Parallel Feature Extraction Algorithms for Sparse Tensors**

## **Documentation ðŸ“‘** 


This is a repository that provides different implementations for extracting the same features from tensors. The input tensor format is COO (*.tns* file format [1]).

```

EXAMPLE: 
```

```

### **Extraction Methods**

All feature extraction methods find the features of the tensor exactly. Users can use whichever method they like. These methods provide different performances depending on the given tensor. 

For 3-mode tensors, all methods return the same set of features.

For M-mode tensors (M>3), only MAP returns the features of all M modes; whereas other methods return the features of the 3 modes with the largest sizes.

To use one, write the choice number of the method as a parameter (the placeholder : [algorithm choice]).

| MethodÂ |Â Description | 
| --------- | ------------|
| **MAP** | Uses `std::unordered_map` to calculate # of nnz per fiber & slice to do the extraction. |
| SORT | Sorts all the modes to make the calculation. |
| GROUP | Groups the slices and fibers according to their indices, similar to sorting except for the last mode. |
| HYBRID | Combination of sort and group |

**MAP** is the default feature extraction method when no choice is provided. 

### **Feature Set**

The program writes the tensor features into a file. 

It first prints the general features, whose meanings are:

```
name  order  sizes[] nnz sparsity sliceCnt fiberCnt nnzSliceCnt nnzFiberCnt slice_sparsity fiber_sparsity
```
The description of general features is shown in the table below.

|Feature Name| Description |
|----|----|
|name | Name of the tensor  |
|order | Order ( mode count) of the tensor  |
|sizes[] | Sizes of the tensor, which is an array of size order  |
|nnz | Number of nonzeros  |
|sparsity | Nonzero density of the tensor  |
|sliceCnt | # of all possible slices (even if it has no nnz) |
|fiberCnt | # of all possible fibers (even if it has no nnz) |
|nnzSliceCnt | # of nonzero slices (which has at least 1 nnz)  |
|nnzFiberCnt | # of nonzero fibers (which has at least 1 nnz) |
|slice_sparsity | Density of nonzero slices  |
|fiber_sparsity | Density of nonzero fibers  |


The program then prints the kind- and mode-dependent features for each mode and kind (nonzeros_per_slice, nonzeros_per_fibers, fibers_per_slice).

For features of nonzeros_per_slice and fibers_per_slice kinds, the output is in the form:
```
id1 id2 all_cnt nz_cnt nz_density max min dev sum avg imbal stDev cv avg_onlynz imbal_onlynz stDev_onlynz cv_onlynz
```
Here id1 and id2 represent the ignored dimensions of mode-(id1, id2) slice

For features of nonzeros_per_fiber kind, the output is in the form:
```
id all_cnt nz_cnt nz_density max min dev sum avg imbal stDev cv avg_onlynz imbal_onlynz stDev_onlynz cv_onlynz
```
Here id represents the ignored dimension of mode-(id) fiber

The description of kind- and mode-dependent features is shown in the table below.

|Feature Name| Description |
|----|----|
|all_cnt |  all count including empty |
|nz_cnt | nonzero count |
|nz_density | nonzero sparsity (nz_cnt / all_cnt) |
|max | maximum value |
|min | minimum value |
|dev | deviation (max â€“ min) |
|sum | summation of values |
|avg | average value (sum / all_cnt) |
|imbal | imbalance : (max-avg)/max |
|stDev | standard deviation |
|cv | coefficient of variation (stDev/avg) |
|avg_onlynz | average by excluding empty (sum / nz_cnt) |
|imbal_onlynz | imbal by excluding empty (max- avg_onlynz)/max |
|stDev_onlynz | stDev by excluding empty |
|cv_onlynz | cv by excluding empty (stDev_onlynz  / avg_onlynz ) |
