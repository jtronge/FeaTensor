# **Paralell Feature Extraction Algorithms for Sparse Tensors**

## **Documentation üìë** 


This is a repository that provides different implementations for extracting the same features from tensors. The input tensor format is COO (*.tns* file format [1]). 

### **Compilation & Running**

To compile and run our main code, use following commands, replace placeholders with corresponding values:

-c csv_out : feture out file to be in csv (1) or json (0) format  [DEFAULT : 1]                                                                                        
-d only3d : features to be in only 3 dim (1) or N-dim (0) [DEFAULT : 0] 

SIMPLEST USAGE:
./featen -i [input-tensor-path] -o [output-file-path]

EXAMPLE: 
./featen -i ../data_tensors/sample_small_3D.tns -o ../features/sample_small_3D_feat.txt
```

### **Extraction Algorithms**

All of the following algorithms output the same set of features. So, one can use whichever method they like. These methods provide different performances depending on the given tensor. 

To use one, write the choice number of the algorithm as parameter when running main (the placeholder : [algorithm choice]).

| Algorithm | N-dim¬†|¬†Description | 
| --------- | ----- | ------------|
| **MAP**¬†| ‚úÖ | Uses `std::unordered_map` to calculate # of nnz per fiber & slice to do the extraction. |
| SORT | ‚ùå (only 3D tensors) | Sorts all the modes to make the calculation. |
| FRAGMENT | ‚ùå (only 3D tensors) | For each mode, sorts the tensor except the last dimension, calculates feature after slightly modifying this structure. |
| HYBRID | ‚ùå (only 3D tensors) | Combination of sort and fragment |

**MAP** is the default feature extraction method when no choice is provided. This is the only method that works for n-dim case. Others are valid for 3-dim case.
