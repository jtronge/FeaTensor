# **Paralell Feature Extraction Algorithms for Sparse Tensors**

## **Documentation ðŸ“‘** 


This is a repository that provides different implementations for extracting the same features from tensors. The input tensor format is COO (*.tns* file format [1]). 

### **Compilation & Running**

To compile and run our main code, use following commands, replace placeholders with corresponding values:

-c csv_out : feture out file to be in csv {1} or json {0} format  [DEFAULT : 1]                                                                                        
-d only3d : features to be in only 3 modes {1} or M modes {0} (only valid for MAP) [DEFAULT : 0] 

SIMPLEST USAGE:
./featen -i [input-tensor-path] -o [output-file-path]

EXAMPLE: 
./featen -i ../data_tensors/sample_small_3D.tns -o ../features/sample_small_3D_feat.txt
```

### **Extraction Methods**

All feature extraction methods find the features of the tensor exactly. Users can use whichever method they like. These methods provide different performances depending on the given tensor. 

For 3-mode tensors, all methods return the same set of features.
For M-mode tensors (M>3), only MAP returns the features of all M modes; whereas other methods return the features of the 3 modes with the largest sizes.

To use one, write the choice number of the method as a parameter (the placeholder : [algorithm choice]).

| MethodÂ |Â Description | 
| --------- | ------------|
| **MAP** | Uses `std::unordered_map` to calculate # of nnz per fiber & slice to do the extraction. |
| SORT | Sorts all the modes to make the calculation. |
| GROUP | Groups the slices and fibers according to their indices, similar to sorting except for the last mode. |
| HYBRID | Combination of sort and group |

**MAP** is the default feature extraction method when no choice is provided.
